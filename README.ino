# 5 LED Blinking Project

This is a simple Arduino Uno project where 5 LEDs are connected to digital pins 2 through 6 and blink in sequence.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- 5 LEDs
- 5 resistors (220 ohm)
- Breadboard and wires

## Circuit Diagram
Connect each LED's positive leg to pins 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 through a resistor. Connect all negative legs to the GND rail.

## How to Upload Code
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Load the `5-led-blink.ino` file.
3. Select the Arduino Uno board.
4. Upload the sketch.

## Notes
- Adjust the delay times to change the blink speed.
- Ensure correct wiring to avoid damaging the board.
